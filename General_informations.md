# Introduction #

GroovyMAME is a fork of MAME designed primarily for CRT monitors but also useful for LCD displays, especially for those models which are capable of refreshing at custom rates.
Its aim is to offer pixel perfect arcade emulation.

Groovymame's main features as compared to official MAME:

- Improved video and audio synchronization that achieves truly smooth scrolling, tearing-free video and hiccup-free sound.

- Automatic generation of custom video timings for CRT monitors.

- Reduced input latency

Note: groovymame already contains mkchamp's patches for high score support/nag screen removal (need to be enabled in mame.ini).
