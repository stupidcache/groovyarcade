# Reporting problems. How to create a log #

If you're experiencing problems with a certain game, please create a log and post it when reporting the problem. This will provide most of the required information beforehand and will save us from asking you to post a log, which depending on your time zone may delay the answer by a couple of days.

Steps to create a log:

- Run groovymame like this:

C:\mame\_folder>groovymame.exe romname -v >romname.txt

- Upload romname.txt as an attachment to your post.

Please don't paste it inside the edit box as it makes things unreadable.
