# Setup #

- Download the official MAME package from MAME's official website.

- Replace the official MAME executable with the groovymame executable.

- Rename the groovymame executable to something more convenient (e.g.: groovymame.exe). This step is optional.

- Use groovymame to create a new mame.ini file. This step is crucial.

Go to command line, and run:

C:\mame\_folder>groovymame.exe -cc

- Edit mame.ini with your ROM paths and monitor type (in the switchres section).
